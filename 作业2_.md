I would prefer to use **b** as it has the best performance.

Though **a**, **b** and **c** are all correct, **b** has the smallest mutex among them. So as long as **b** is proved to be correct, we can prove the correctness of all of them. I am going to explain this then. Considering that the hash number won't cause any race condition, the race condition in multithreaded hash table derives from conducting insertion, looking up and removment at the same time.Therefore, we shall add a lock on each hash bin to avoid such a situation., that's exactly what **b** does. 

Then I will explain that **b** has the best performance. **a** adds a mutex over the entire table, making at most one thread can access the hash table. However, actions such as looking up two items in two different hash bins won't result in race condition， adding such a big lock will definitely reduce parallelism. What's more, considering that only one thread can enter hash bin each time, having an additional mutex over each element will make our hash table slower.

This implementation has some problems. 

- Firstly, if $$item1 == NULL$$ , then **signal(q1->lock)** will never run, which leads **q1->lock** lasts
  forever  
- Secondly, if $$item2 == NULL$$, then both **signal(q1->lock)** and **signal(q2->lock)** will never run,
  which leads **q1->lock** and **q2->lock** last forever  
- Finally, if two threads call **atomic_swap(q1,q2)** and **atomic_swap(q2,q1)** simultaneously, the first
  thread will gain **q1->lock** and the second thread will gain **q2->lock**, and both threads will wait for the other to release its lock, which makes both threads block forever

### My Solution：

```c++
void atomic_swap(Queue *q1, Queue *q2){
    Item *item1;
    Item *item2;
    wait(q1->lock);
    item1 = pop(q1);
    signal(q1->lock);
    wait(q2->lock);
    item2 = pop(q2);
    signal(q2->lock);
    if (item1 != NULL && item2 != NULL) 
    {
        wait(q2->lock);
        push(q2, item1);
        signal(q2->lock);
        wait(q1->lock);
        push(q1, item2);
        signal(q1->lock);
	}
}

```

### a

```c++
int smoker_count = 0;
int nonsmoker_count = 0;
```

### b

```
semaphore smoker_mutex = 1;	// to upgrade sc
semaphore nonsmoker_mutex = 1; 	// to upgrade nc
semaphore smoker_not_in = 1;	// smoker not in lounge
semaphore nonsmoker_not_in = 1;	// nonsmoker not in lounge
semaphore mutex = 1;	// enter lunge sequentially
```

### c

```c++
// smoker

enter_lounge(true)
{
	wait(mutex);
	signal(mutex);
}

smoke()
{
 	wait(smoker_mutex);
    smoker_count++;
    if (smoker_count == 1) 
        wait(smoker_not_in);
    signal(smoker_mutex);
}

leave_lounge(true)
{
    wait(smoker_mutex);
    smoker_count--;
    if (smoker_count == 0) 
        signal(sNotIn);
    signal(smoker_mutex);
}
```

```c++
// nonsmoker
// smoker

enter_lounge(false)
{
	wait(mutex);
    wait(smoker_not_in);
    smoker_count++;
    if (smoker_count == 1) 
        wait(smoker_not_in);
    signal(nNotIn);
    signal(mutex);
}

leave_lounge(false)
{
   	wait(nonsmoker_mutex);
    nonsmoker_count--;
    if (nonsmoker_count == 0) 
        signal(nNotIn);
    signal(nonsmoker_mutex);
}
```

### d

The three properties are **mutual exclusion**, **progress** and **bounded waiting**.

- Mutual Exclusion
  - **smoker_mutex**(or **nonsmoker_mutex**) promises that only one thread can modify **smoker_count**( or **nonsmoker_count**). mutex promises that smokers and nonsmokers cannot enter the lounge at the same time. **smoker_not_in** and **nonsmoker_not_in** promise that smokers cannot enter the lounge full of nonsmokers and nonsmokers cannot enter the lounge full of smokers  
- Progress
  - For example, if two smokers want to modify **smoker_count** simultaneously. The latter one will be blocked by **smoker_mutex**, but after the first one leaves its critical region and calls **signal(smoker_mutex)**, the latter one will then gain the lock and enter the critical region  
- Bounded Waiting  
  - Once the number of smokers and nonsmokers is finite, smokers(or nonsmokers) will enter the lounge when all nonsmokers (smokers) have left and that won't lead to starvation.
